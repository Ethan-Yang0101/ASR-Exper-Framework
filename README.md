# End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition Experimental Framework

## Introduction
This is an experimental framework for end-to-end ASR system. The currently supported end-to-end ASR system was based on Joint CTC Attention Model proposed by Suyoun Kim et al. Multiple heuristics were also implemented, such as Dropout, Label Smoothing and Scheduled Sampling, serving as additional plug-ins for better performance. Currently supported experiments are to investigate the reasons for the performance improvement of ASR systems by evaluating model calibration, exposure bias, and decoder stopping ability.
